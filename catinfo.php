    <h4>1.CAT PROTIEN</h4>
    <p>1.Cats can obtain all their essential amino acids from animal protein. <br><br>2.Proteins are the building blocks of organs and tissues, including cartilage, tendons, hair, skin, blood,<br><br> muscles, and the heart.<br><br>3. They are part of enzymes, hormones, and antibodies.<br><br>

       4.Complete & balanced cat food should include animal protein from such meats as turkey, chicken or<br><br> beef, as well as fish and eggs.<br> <br>4.Feeding your cat a well-balanced diet assists in the healthy functioning and regeneration of body tissues and helps keep their claws and fur <br><br>strong and healthy.</p>
<br>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img class="img1" src="http://localhost/PawPrints/PawPrints/images/Fish.jpg" alt="Paris" width="300" height="300">
        <h4>2.FATS</h4>
        <p>
            1.Animal fats are the main source of energy for cats. “Good fats” is a term used to describe fats <br><br>naturally present in meat and fish as well as the essential fatty acids such as Omega 3 and Omega 6<br><br> fatty acids.<br><br>2. These “good fats” are fundamental to feline health.<br><br>

           3.“Fats help a cat maintain body temperature, provide energy and absorb vitamins such as A, D, E and<br><br> K,”.<br><br> 4.“Because cats can only receive ‘“good fats’” through what they consume, it is important the cat food you provide is enriched with Omega 3 and<br><br> Omega 6.”

    <div>
        <img class="img1" src="http://localhost/PawPrints/PawPrints/images/Carbohydrates.jpg" alt="Paris" width="300" height="300">
        <h4>3.CARBOHYDRATES</h4>
        <p>1.Although carbohydrates are not typically seen as essential nutrients in the diets of cats, carbs<br><br> do play critical roles in your cat’s body. <br><br>2.Carbohydrates provide a highly digestible, readily available energy source and should be present in<br><br> all cat foods.<br><br>

           3.Cats can get their necessary carbs from grains like wheat and rice.<br><br>4.Because these grains are typically added ingredients in many wet cat foods, these carbohydrate sources are pre-treated to facilitate digestibility <br><br>and absorption into your cat’s body.<br><br>5. Carbohydrates from uncooked soybeans and other legumes should be avoided as they contain many antinutritional factors.</p>
    </div>

<h4>4.WATER</h4>
        <img class="img1" src="http://localhost/PawPrints/PawPrints/images/Dog-water.jpg" alt="Paris" width="300" height="300">
        <p>1.This one may seem like a no-brainer, but did you know cats tend to consume less water than they<br><br> need? “Seventy percent of a cat is water.<br><br>2.In the past, cats lived in natural habitats with restricted access to clean drinking water,”.<br><br>3.Through evolution, cats have adapted to this situation by obtaining the majority of the water they <br><br>need through the food they eat.”

        <h4>5.MINERALS</h4>
<p>
    1.Like vitamins, minerals are also essential to all mammals.<br><br> 2.Minerals contribute to enzyme formation, pH balance, nutrient utilization, and oxygen transportation.<br> <br>3.Elemental minerals are generally taken from the earth or water; chelated minerals are those that are<br><br> bound with other organic substances, often making them easier for the body to absorb.<br><br>4.There are a few minerals that are essential to our cat’s health.<br> <br>5.These include iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and chloride.<br><br>

<h3>How to train a cat to Come on command</h3>
        <img class="img1" src="http://localhost/PawPrints/PawPrints/images/catcommand.jpg" alt="Paris" width="300" height="300">
    <p>
        1.Cats can learn to respond to a vocal cue and run your way.<br><br>
        2.This step of how to train a cat starts by making a distinct noise before feeding—before you open a <br><br>bag or can—like vocally call your cat, or click your tongue. <br><br>3.Your pet will learn to associate that noise with something positive (food) and will eventually head to<br><br> you when it hears it.<br><br> 4.Then, encourage this behavior outside of normal feeding times.<br><br> Start from short distances.<br><br> 5.Make the noise, use your clicker when your cat comes, and then reward your pet with the treat. <br><br>6.Over time, call the cat from longer distances.

<h3>How to train a cat to Use a toilet</h3>
        <img class="img1" src="http://localhost/PawPrints/PawPrints/images/cattoilet.jpg" alt="Paris" width="300" height="300">
<p>
    1.Training a cat to use the toilet definitely takes some work, but think of the benefits: You’ll save on<br><br> litter and enjoy a cleaner home.<br><br> 2.First, place a litter box adjacent to your toilet.<br><br> 3.Then gradually bring it closer and closer to the top of seat—you might need a stool to make the<br><br> process easier on the cat.<br><br> 4.Once your pet is accustomed to using a litter box<br><br> on top of the toilet, transition to a special litter box that fits within the toilet itself.

        <img class="img1" src="http://localhost/PawPrints/PawPrints/images/cathandshake.jpg" alt="Paris" width="300" height="300">
<h3>How to train a cat to Shake hands</h3>

<p>
    1.This cat training is simpler than you might expect: Get a treat ready, then align yourself to the same <br><br>level as your cat.<br><br>2. Tap your cat’s paw while saying “shake,” and use your clicker when it moves its paw. <br><br>3.Repeat training until your cat offers its paw in response to the “shake” command without tapping.<br><br>4. Like the “come on command” trick, this can take a few training sessions over the course of a couple<br><br> of days.

    <h3>How to train a cat to Walk on a leash</h3>
        <img class="img1" src="http://localhost/PawPrints/PawPrints/images/catleach.jpg" alt="Paris" width="300" height="300">
<p>
    1.Get a harness with a leash that attaches at the cat’s back, not its neck.<br><br>
    2.The ASPCA recommends that before putting it on you leave it out for a few days in areas where<br><br> your cat goes, like its feeding area or favorite sleeping spot, so that the animal is accustomed to the <br><br>sight of it.<br><br>3. Next, you’ll transition to draping the harness over the cat when giving it<br><br> a treat.<br><br>
    4.Once your pet is comfortable with the harness, attach the leash to it, and let your cat wander freely inside with it.<br><br>5. After a few days, start holding the leash during training.<br><br>

    <h3>HYPERESTHESIA</h3>
        <img class="img1" src="http://localhost/PawPrints/PawPrints/images/cathyper.jpg" alt="Paris" width="300" height="300">
    <p>1.Hyperesthesia is a syndrome that is not completely understood.<br><br> 2.Cats with this problem are overly sensitive to being touched, especially along the back.<br><br> 3.They may howl or become agitated when handled.<br><br> 4.A cat may groom the area excessively, hiss at or bite its back, cry, dash away, or defecate.<br><br> 5.Your veterinarian will first rule out medical causes, especially pain and skin conditions, which can<br><br> cause similar signs.<br><br> 6.If a medical condition is not present, a compulsive disorder may be to blame.</p>
    <br></div>
    <div>

        <h3>COMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR</h3>
        <img class="img1" src="http://localhost/PawPrints/PawPrints/images/catcompulsive.jpg" alt="Paris" width="300" height="300">
        <p>1.Compulsive behavior also occurs in cats. These are otherwise normal behaviors that occur out of<br><br> context or so often that they interfere with normal activity. <br><br>2.The most common types are excessive grooming, and chewing of wool, other fabrics, plastic, rubber,<br><br> cardboard, or string.<br><br>3. In many cats compulsive behavior results from stress or anxiety.<br><br>4.Chewing wool or other fabrics tends to occur in Siamese and similar breeds and is likely inherited. <br><br>5.Your veterinarian can help you with a behavior modification program and medication in order to manage these types of behavior problems.<br><br></p>
    </div>
    <div>

        <h3>FEAR</h3>
        <img class="img1" src="http://localhost/PawPrints/PawPrints/images/catfear.jpg" alt="Paris" width="300" height="300">
       <p>
           1.Fear can result from insufficient early socialization as a kitten or frightening experiences.It can also<br><br> be inherited.<br><br> 2. Cats may fear unfamiliar people, unfamiliar cats, dogs, noises, or places and situations such as <br><br>car rides, veterinary visits, and unfamiliar environments.<br><br>3. Some cats may also be fearful of familiar people and cats.<br><br>4. Fear can result in threatening behavior (such as growling or hissing), overt aggression (biting or <br></br>scratching), avoidance, hiding, and possibly spraying.<br><br>5. If possible, it is best to identify what is causing the fear.<br><br>6. Your veterinarian can then create a treatment plan that includes avoidance (if possible), behavior modification techniques, and possibly <br></br>medications.

    <h3>OLDER CATS</h3>
    <img class="img1" src="http://localhost/PawPrints/PawPrints/images/catsold.jpg" alt="Paris" width="300" height="300">
    <p>
        1.Older cats can experience a number of medical conditions that can cause abnormal behaviors. <br><br>2.They can also have pathologically abnormal behaviors, which can be more difficult to treat than<br><br> those seen in younger animals.<br><br>3.Older cats may also have cognitive dysfunction syndrome, which is similar to Alzheimer disease in<br><br> people and can cause disorientation, agitation, anxiety, memory loss, housesoiling, and personality<br><br> changes.<br><br> 4.If you notice behavioral changes in your older cat, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian, who will rule out medical conditions and<br><br> develop an appropriate treatment plan.<br><br>

<div id="grooming" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>BRUSHING BASICS</h3>
    <p>Regular brushing offers benefits such as dead hair and dirt, and removing or preventing mats and tangles.<br>
    <h4>For shorthaired cats:</h4>

    <img class="img1" src="http://localhost/PawPrints/PawPrints/images/catgroom.jpg" alt="Paris" width="300" height="300">

        1.Start with a fine-toothed metal comb.Run it through the cat’s fur from head to tail tip.<br><br> 2.Watch for small pepper-like specks that could indicate the presence of cat fleas.<br><br>
        3.Use a bristle or soft rubber brush next to remove loose hair.<br>
        <h4>For longhaired cats:</h4>


        1.Start with a wide-toothed comb to remove debris that may be caught in the cat’s coat. Carefully<br><br> untangle any knots.<br><br>
        2.Next use a wire brush or a bristle brush to remove loose hair.<br><br>
        3.Consider using a toothbrush to brush around the cat’s face.<br>

    <h3>BATH TIME </h3>
    <img class="img1" src="http://localhost/PawPrints/PawPrints/images/catbath.jpg" alt="Paris" width="300" height="300">
    <p>1.Start by making the water temperature pleasant. It should be warm – not hot, and not cold.<br><br>
        2.Use a shampoo that’s made specifically for use with cats, and labeled accordingly.<br><br>
        3.Gently wet the cat down using a spray hose, but DO NOT spray or pour water directly on the cat’s<br><br> head – you don’t want to spray or pour into the cat’s eyes, ears or nose. <br>
       <br> 4.Start at the cat’s head, and gently work in the shampoo from head to tail.<br><br>
        5.Rinse gently but thoroughly, making sure that all the shampoo is rinsed out. Again, be sure to avoid <br><br>spraying or pouring water directly on the cat’s head.<br><br>
        6.Gently pat dry with a large towel.</p>

    <h3>PEDICURE</h3>
    <img class="img1" src="http://localhost/PawPrints/PawPrints/images/catpedicure.jpg" alt="Paris" width="300" height="300">

    <p>
        1.Start out by spending some time just training your cat to be comfortable and accepting of having<br><br> her feet handled.<br><br>
        2.Begin to massage its feet on a daily basis. Do that by running your hand along its leg, and then very <br><br>gently pressing with your thumb on the pad of each toe, causing the claw to extend. <br><br>
        3. After a week or two the cat will likely become comfortable with its daily foot massage.<br><br>

        4.Once the cat is comfortable with the massaging, it’s ok to clip. <br><br>
        5.Use a quality, sharp clipper or nail scissors specifically designed for use on cats. <br><br>
        6.Cut parallel to the flat of the claw, and clip off only the white tip.<br><br>
